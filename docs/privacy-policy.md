**Last Updated:** February 28, 2026

Bear Metal Apps, a subteam of FRC Team 2046 (Tahoma Robotics), operates the Beariscope mobile and desktop application ("the App"). This policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.

## 1. Information We Collect

### Account Information
When you create an account or sign in via Auth0, we collect:
- **Name** – your first and last name
- **Email address** – used for account identification and communication
- **Profile photo** – optional; uploaded by you

### Usage Information
We do not collect analytics, crash reports, or usage telemetry beyond what is necessary to operate the App.

### Third-Party Data
The App retrieves publicly available FRC competition data from:
- **The Blue Alliance** (thebluealliance.com) – match schedules, team information
- **FRC Nexus** (frc.nexus) – event pit and queue information

We do not store this data permanently; it is cached locally on your device for offline use.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information solely to:
- Authenticate you and maintain your session
- Display your profile within the App
- Associate scouting contributions with your account
- Communicate account-related notifications (e.g., email verification, password reset)

We do **not** sell, share, or disclose your information to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

## 3. Data Storage and Security

- Account data is stored securely via **Auth0** (auth0.com), a third-party identity platform.
- Profile photos are stored in **Microsoft Azure Blob Storage**.
- All communication between the App and our servers uses HTTPS/TLS encryption.

### Auth0 Privacy Policy

## 4. Data Retention

Your account data is retained as long as your account is active. When you delete your account through the App, your Auth0 account and associated profile data are permanently deleted within 30 days.

Locally cached data (match schedules, team data) is stored only on your device and can be cleared by uninstalling the App.
